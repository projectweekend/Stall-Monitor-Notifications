## What this does

This connects to RabbitMQ, listens for messages from [Stall-Monitor-Raspberry-Pi](https://github.com/projectweekend/Stall-Monitor-Raspberry-Pi). When a message is received, the status of the bathroom stall door is sent out via a [GCM](https://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html).
